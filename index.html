        <p><i>Branches</i> is a crowdsourced interactive narrative that explores and celebrates creative differences on
            a large scale. You can read through branching stories created by users, and you can add your own branches,
            too! If you don't like the direction a story is taking, then just take it in a different direction! Come
            back later to see if anyone has expanded on your writing!
        </p>
        <p>Use the left and right arrow keys to select a branch to follow. The down arrow will select the currently
            highlighted branch, and the up arrow will return to the previous passage. To create a new branch, navigate
            to the plus icon on the far right and press the down arrow to select it. You can type your own part of the
            story, and press Enter to add it to the narrative!
